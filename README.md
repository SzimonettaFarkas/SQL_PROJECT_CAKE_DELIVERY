# SQL_PROJECT_CAKE_DELIVERY

Umer, a cafe owner, came up with an idea. He observed that his customers rather stay at home when the weather is cold in winter. He decided to start a cake delivery service for people who would like to enjoy a piece of cake at their warm and cosy home. 

The 10 menu items customers can get delivered :
Butter Cake, Chocolate Cake, Red Velvet Cake, Pineapple Cake, Coffee Cake, Apple Cake, Cheesecake, Strawberry Cake, Lemon Cake, Honey Cake.

Umer wants to gain insights about his service idea, so he requested me to help analyzing a collection of data about his customers.
